Warning (35016): Found partition port(s) not driving logic, possibly wasting area
Warning: RST port on the PLL is not properly connected on instance sys_pll:sys_pll_inst|sys_pll_0002:sys_pll_inst|altera_pll:altera_pll_i|general[1].gpll. The reset port on the PLL should be connected. If the PLL loses lock for any reason, you might need to manually reset the PLL in order to re-establish lock to the reference clock.
